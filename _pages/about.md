I am a Lecturer in Logic at the University of Salzburg. I obtained my PhD in 2025 from the Center for Logic, Language, and Cognition (LLC) at the University of Turin.

My research lies at the intersection of logic, the philosophy of mathematics, and the philosophy of language. I am particularly interested in the philosophy of set theory and theories of truth, as well as their connections to proof theory and semantic frameworks for higher-order languages.

In my dissertation, Bicontextualism for Truths and Sets, I develop a bipartite semantics that allows for partial absolutism: some sentences admit genuinely unrestricted quantification, while others (notably those involved in paradoxical reasoning) require contextual restriction. This yields a principled middle ground between classical absolutism and generality relativism.

Beyond this work, I am involved in projects on Feferman’s unfolding program (with Martin Fischer and David Hofmann), contextualism in set theory (with Lorenzo Rossi and Chris Scambler), and the universe–multiverse debate (with Matteo de Ceglie).
